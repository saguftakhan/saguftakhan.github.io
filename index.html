<h3>Course I Found Most Useful: ITM 550 - Advanced e-Business</h3>
<p>The course I found most useful in the BTM program was ITM 550: Advanced e-Business. It was incredibly hands-on and gave me practical experience in building an e-commerce website using Shopify. We did everything from deciding the font size of navigation menus to editing product photos. The website was designed to be accessibility friendly, so it is usable by people with disabilities. This project helped me understand the entire process of creating an e-commerce site and ensuring it meets real-world requirements.
