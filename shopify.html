 <!-- OPTIONAL: As a preview to next week's lab on accessibility, I opt for using section tags because,
      as explained here https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/Region_role,
	  they make it slightly easier for people using screen readers. Screen readers read the text on a webpage
	  (and its code to some extent) so that users with visual disabilities (such as blindness or low-vision)
	  can navigate and understand all parts of the webpage. You may continue to use div tags for this lab -->

    <!-- The point of sections is they represent logically separated sections of content,
         so we should provide headings for each section (again, this good for accessibility too) -->

    <!-- Because they are intended for articles and similar groups of content, I'm
		using articles within my section tags, but it is not mandatory -->
		<article>
		<video id="video1" width="400" height="250" controls>
			<!-- The statement between video tags is a special feature-- it appears *only* if you're using such a browser.
				 Any captions or other text should be placed within <p>, not between video tags -->
		  <source src="shopify website.mp4" type="video/mp4">
			Your browser does not support the video tag.
