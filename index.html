<p>SEO Techniques <br> <br> Keyword Targeting  <br> <br>
  Keyword targeting in SEO refers to choosing the right words or phrases people use to search online. In my case, it is hiring managers who may search for certain skills or roles. Adding these keywords to my website can help hiring managers find me. Additionally, I can use long-tail keywords for more specific searches. By understanding what visitors are looking for, I can make my content more engaging. </p>
<br> 
  <p>Backlinks <br> <br>
  “A backlink is a link that one website gets from another.” They help improve SEO by showing search engines that my site is trustworthy. If I get backlinks from well-known and reliable sources, it can improve my SEO and bring more visitors to my portfolio. For my personal portfolio website, more backlinks will make my website more credible. </p>
<br>
  <p>Mobile Optimization <br> <br>
  Mobile SEO is important because most people search the internet on their phones. Google tends to rank websites higher if they work well on mobile devices, so making my website mobile-friendly is essential to be at the top of search results. If my personal portfolio isn’t mobile-friendly, I could miss out on visitors and potential opportunities. By optimizing my site for mobile, like making it load fast and easy to use, I can attract more hiring managers and showcase my work effectively.</p>
<br> <br> 
<p> SMO Techniques <br> <br> Integrate social into my website <br> <br> 
  Integrating social media into my website allows visitors to connect with me. I can include sharing buttons, links to my social profiles, and options for visitors to log in using their social accounts. These features help more people see my work and share it with others, increasing visibility.</p>
<br>
  <p> Share quality content <br> <br>
  For my personal portfolio website, sharing high-quality content is important. Posting creative and quality content keeps people interested in my work. Content like short videos, helpful tips, or project highlights can attract attention. Regular and consistent posting helps more people discover my website through social platforms. </p>
<br>
  <p> Optimize posts for searches <br> <br> 
  I can make my social media posts more visible by using short, catchy titles and relevant hashtags. For example, if I share a post about project management tips, I can put it as a question like, "Looking for ways to manage projects efficiently?" This makes my posts easier to find.  </p>
