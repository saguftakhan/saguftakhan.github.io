<h3>Course I Found Most Useful: ITM 550 - Advanced e-Business</h3>
<p>The course I found most useful in the BTM program was ITM 550: Advanced e-Business. It was incredibly hands-on and gave me practical experience in building a fully functional e-commerce website using Shopify. We did everything from deciding the font size of navigation menus to editing product photos. One of the most valuable aspects was ensuring that the website was accessibility-friendly, meaning it was designed to be usable by people with disabilities such as deafness, blindness, and dyslexia. This project helped me understand the entire process of creating an e-commerce site and ensuring it meets real-world requirements.
